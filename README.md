# Sign Language Recognition with LSTM

This project is focused on sign language recognition using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. The system captures keypoints from signers' hand movements and translates them into text using deep learning techniques.

## üìÇ Files

### 1. `signlanguage keypoints collection.ipynb`
- This notebook is used for collecting keypoints from signers' videos using MediaPipe.
- It extracts hand landmarks and stores them for model training.

### 2. `sign-language lstm model.ipynb`
- This notebook contains the training pipeline for the LSTM model.
- It loads keypoint data, trains an LSTM-based neural network, and saves the trained model.

### 3. `test.ipynb`
- This notebook is for testing the trained LSTM model.
- It takes sign language inputs and predicts corresponding text.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide
